# rmu_combat_roller
A Combat Roller for Rolemaster Unified.

Out of respect for ICE, I have removed the ability to see their combat tables, only a few can be accessed via the database.

Technology Stack:
- Python 3.11,
- SQLite3,
- HTML/JS,
- Bootstrap 4.1.1,

Libraries:
- Flask,
- SQLAlchemy
- sqlite3, 
- random

Visual considerations: An order-handler for structuring the symbols in the critical results to match the updated book (from core release) may be a good aesthetic improvememnt.

Feel free to download and use in your campaigns!  May all your hits be crits, and never trip over an imaginary, deceased turtle.
